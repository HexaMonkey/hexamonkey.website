			<p>The hexamonkey started as a final year project at <a href="http://www.ecp.fr/">Ecole Centrale Paris.</a></p>
            <p>We welcome any new format implemented using the <a href="hmdoc.php">hmscript</a> language. For an idea on how to do this, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/HexaMonkey/hexamonkey/tree/master/scripts">existing scripts</a>. You can just drop your script in your ~/.hexamonkey directory and they will be taken into account next time you compile.</p>
            <p>There is also a lot to do on the core compiler and on the UI side. Please contact us if you want to help, we have plenty of ideas.</p>
            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>The easiest way to contact us at this point is through github issues and pull request.</p>
            <p>We also sometimes hang out on irc, channel #hexamonkey on irc.freenode.net, you might see us there from time to time.</p>
